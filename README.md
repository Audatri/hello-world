Introduction to using GitHub with "Hello World" project

My name is Austin. I am a beginning learner of web development and a CS student at university.
I hope to use the Odin Project to enhance my skillset and am following their tutorial now.
Hopefully I can one day learn enough to make this a full-time position, but I am now learning for the
  sake of it.
My favorite language to use so far has been Java, but I expect that to change once I view more 
  languages.
